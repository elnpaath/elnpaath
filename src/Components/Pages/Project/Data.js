          "This is a branding project whereby I visualized the brand identity of a particular brand, which was Kopi Cat’s Cafe. The brand identity is in the form of loge, choices of color scheme, as well as brand pattern, which was then applied to products such as the cafe’s front sign, takeout boxes, coffee cups, paper bag, menus, and stationaries for the company. Kopi Cat’s Cafe is a cat cafe owned by a pet service company Groovy that provides a hang out place where cat lovers can dine and play with cats. Kopi Cat’s known for its cozy interior that is relaxing and memorable, and its high quality cats that are clean and friendly. I have chosen this brand because it has so much potential with its quality service that is unique in Jakarta, with few competitors. There is also room for improvements for their current logo and brand identity.",

The brand identity, which is applied solely on this particular product, vegetable chips was to some extent, predicated upon the personality of the owner, that I had an interview session with, as well as the quality of her product. Her personality can be described as bubbly and youthful, despite her mature age. Hence, I chose to use bright, light-toned colors. The vegetables used for her product are organic and fresh. Hence, I have incoorporated organic shapes in the logo, as well as the illustrations on the packaging. Moreover, compared to the old one, not only is the new design more modern, but it is color coordinated per type of vegetables, creating identity for them. To mantain practicality for the owner, a check box system is still used for the flavour choices, which were not available in the old packaging.",

After brainstorming book ideas and browsing through some available journals, I have finally chosen to do a book on the habits and lifestyles of happy people. This topic is appealing to me because it highlights the practical ways in which people can obtain happiness, which is something that can be challenging considering the fact that we live in a highly competitive and stressful world. It also touches on psychology, which is a subject that I am very interested in.
